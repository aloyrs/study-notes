In a CPU:

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) : Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- Registers: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU that hold data and instructions temporarily. (faster than accessing RAM)
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) : Each CPU is designed to execute a specific ISA, which defines the set of instructions and operations it can perform
- Bus : A communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. Consists of a set of physical connections like wires or cables, and protocols that manage the data transmission. Buses can carry data, address, and control signals.
