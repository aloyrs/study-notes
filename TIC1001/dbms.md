- DB Schema : structured blueprint of a database, defining tables, fields, data types, relationships, constraints

Users - use SQL -> in DBMS -> which affects DB

**ACID** :

Atomicity: Either all or none are executed (eg. Bank transaction)

Consistency: Ensure consistent data type , etc.

Isolation: Ensures that transactions happening at the same time do not affect each other(eg. 2 bank transcations at the same time on same account)

Durability: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent even in cases of power loss, crashes, or errors.
