# Selection sort

- O(n^2)
- loops through to find the smallest/largest to form sorted sub-array on left/right respectively
- loop through remaining till array is sorted

# Bubble sort

- Look at two elements and compare the values , if left > right then swap , keep swapping until the largest is on the right (largest bubbles up to the right)

- the right side forms a sorted sub-array, repeat until all large values bubble up to the right , array will be sorted small to large

# Insertion sort
