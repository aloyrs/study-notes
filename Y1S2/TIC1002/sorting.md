# Selection sort

- O(n^2)
- loops through to find the smallest/largest to form sorted sub-array on left/right respectively
- loop through remaining till array is sorted

# Bubble sort

- Look at two elements and compare the values , if left > right then swap , keep swapping until the largest is on the right (largest bubbles up to the right)

- the right side forms a sorted sub-array, repeat until all large values bubble up to the right , array will be sorted small to large

# Insertion sort

- Start from left , assume first element in array is sorted.
- Work from left to right from index 1 to check if it is in the right place in accordance to the sorted array (if its smaller then swap with values in sorted array to find its place)
- Keep looping until each value is in the sorted array, array will be sorted smallest to largest

# Counting sort
