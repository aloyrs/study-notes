- arithmetic sequence = sequence with common difference in two consecutive terms
- sum of arithmetic sequence

- geometric sequence
- sum of geometric sequence

- limits of sequence
- sum to infinity of geometric sequence

- Telescoping sum : basically cancel off terms and end up with fixed no. of terms

- Mathematical Induction : Prove a that sum of sequence = something

  - test P(1) is true
  - Sub k and k+1 in to P(n) , eg

$$
\frac{n}{n+1} , \text{ so } \frac{k}{k+1} \text{ and } \frac{k+1}{k+2},
$$

$$
\text{sub in } \frac{k}{k+1} \text{ into } \frac{k+1}{k+2} \text{ to solve}
$$
